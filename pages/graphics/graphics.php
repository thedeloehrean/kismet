                    Designer, and Graphic designer with a focus on eCommerce living in Ferndale, MI.</h4>

                <p>He has over 20 years of front-end, user-centered (UI), structure-oriented, design experience comprised of
                    website design and development, software application design and development, consulting, company
                    branding, marketing, graphic design, and search engine optimization (SEO).</p>

                <p>Andrew is an expert in graphic design (digital and illustration), web design and styling (CSS), proper
                    website architecture (HTML, W3C Compliance, Browser Compatibility), and has the knowledge, skills, and
                    experience to address and solve your company, band, or personal creative, innovative, and technical
                    needs.</p>

                <p>In 2000, he was a sophomore in high school and had just finished his first web development class. He had
                    toyed with building websites before but learned enough in the course to begin building his first real
                    website for his band, Forever Ending. Since a child, he had always loved to draw and play music. Now,
                    with his newfound knowledge of HTML and CSS, he was able to begin putting what he loved to use on the
                    Internet.</p>

                <p>Before long, Andrew Loehr was designing tee shirts, marketing ads, album artwork, and websites for a
                    number of bands in the Detroit area and many bands from around the country in the early 2000s under his
                    first unofficial company, Loehr Concept &amp; Design. His ability to combine hand-drawn art, digital
                    photography, digital graphics, and web development gave bands an all-inclusive designer for any project
                    they needed.</p>

                <p>In 2004, Andrew began to record artists in his basement from everything between demos, EPs, and
                    full-length albums. He started a record label and multimedia design firm called Horseshoe Records, which
                    is still active today. He has engineered, mixed, and/or mastered over 15 projects to date, created
                    custom-designed merchandise, websites, advertisements, and album artwork for bands, other record labels,
                    and clothing companies, including Hopeless Records, Royden, What Happened in Vegas, Alucard, Skin Thread
                    Clothing Co., The Weakend, and many more and is currently in the process of building a new sound studio
                    to suit his and his clients growing needs.</p>

                <p>As Andrew continued to do freelance graphic and web work, he was contracted into Moosejaw.com for his
                    skills in 2007 and was promoted to Assistant Webmaster by early 2009. He ran a daily analysis of the
                    product database and corrected errors by identifying improper information for products, descriptions,
                    and things that could affect front-end functionality. Andrew was also responsible for updating new and
                    carryover product images, original content, and descriptions for a wide variety of outdoor equipment,
                    clothing, and footwear brands. He also organized creative elements for scheduled daily newsletters sent
                    to hundreds of thousands of customers.</p>

                <p>In 2010, Andrew was hired as a full-time graphic assistant at LocoX.com, a motocross eCommerce store on a
                    Volusion platform. During his first year, he was responsible for the creative elements of weekly
                    newsletters and sent campaigns to over 100,000 customers as well as used comparative analytics to adjust
                    future campaigns and helped the company move the store from Volusion to Netsuite. He created and
                    designed over 400 advertisements for featured products throughout the website, product marketing
                    efforts, email campaigns, the Google Ad Network, and advertisements in Transworld, RacerX, VitalMX,
                    Facebook, and more. By 2011, he was promoted to the position of Website Manager and developed a cleaner
                    and more intuitive landing page structure for each storefront, and designed and implemented new
                    templates for categories and items based on market research and knowledge of W3C and SEO rules for
                    faster load times, better search engine visibility, more organized content, and better overall user
                    experience.</p>

                <p>By the end of 2011, Andrew Loehr launched an online software and web development firm with his father
                    called Brighter Technology as the Chief Design Officer. As a team, they have developed 7 very different
                    websites with custom applications in environments like BigCommerce, Concrete5, and WHMCS. Together, they
                    developed entire multimedia packages, company branding and marketing strategies, and websites for local
                    and national businesses, such as The Huntsville Haunted Corn Maze, Pant Saggin Dezign Clothing Company,
                    Rocket City Titans Football Team, Brighter12.com, and developed BrighterHost.com as a web hosting
                    solution for their clients.</p>

                <p>Andrew currently works for Neon Workforce Technologies as their UI/UX Developer and Software Tester. He
                    is still active with Brighter Technology and Horseshoe Records as a freelance designer and continues to
                    record music in his free time.</p>
